        <p>I created this game merely for fun. We played a similar game with some friends
          while watching season 6, and I was surprised how popular it got. So since I'm a web
          developer, I deciced to ditch the old spread&shy;sheets we used, and implement the game
          properly.</p>
        <p>I hope you enjoy it just as well as I enjoyed creating it. :)</p>
        <p>If you have any questions, please feel free to drop a mail to <i>korteur@gmail.com.</i>

        <p>Cheers,<br/>GÃ¡bor</p>
